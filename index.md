## News   
* **02/2023**: Our work on Multiscale Encoder-Decoder Video Transformer accepted to [CVPR 2023](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com)

## Research Area
My research is in the general area of **Computer Vision** with a special focus on **Video Understanding**. My  demonstrated research experience includes using multiscale spatiotemporal attention mechanism for video segmentation, distributed feedback for scene segmentation, vehicle trajectory prediction from birds-eye-view videos for autonomous driving.

<!--
## Highlights
* 7 years of research and development experience on various industry and academic projects
* Hands-on experience in implementing novel models for research experiments focused in a wide varieties of computer vision problems with a strong peer-reviewed publication track record
* Deep understanding of the theories behind machine learning, deep learning, CNN, transformers, spatiotemporal oriented energy networks, and computer vision algorithms
* Good understanding of latest academic computer vision papers, and the state-of-the-art algorithms for a wide variety of problems in image and video understanding tasks
* Demonstrated experience in implementing computer vision algorithms for the task of classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, action recognition, and adversarial attack/defense
on CNN using standard libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn) and popular deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras)
